        "In this tutorial we're going to walk you through the construction of visualizations using Altair--a tool to encode data using a Grammar of Graphics implementation (one called Vega-Lite). [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) is a Python API to [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). When we code in Altair we are ultimately producing a data structure that tells Vega-Lite what to draw. Whatever is doable in Vega-Lite should be doable in Altair so you can always look at examples in one and figure out how to generate them in the other ([Vega-Lite Examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/) and [Altair Examples](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html)). \n",
        "\n",
        "As a side note, Vega-Lite is a lighter variant of [Vega](https://vega.github.io/). Altair and Vega-Lite are equally capable. Vega, on the other hand, is much more full-featured but there is no API in Python at the moment. \n",
        "\n",
        "Internally, we are describing the visualization in a JSON object--a kind of data structure that has lists and dictionaries. This will allow the rendering system (the thing that draws on the screen) to intepret your Grammar of Graphics specficiation. You can always ask Altair to produce the Vega-Lite JSON object (and you can experiment directly with this JSON object in the [Vega/Vega-Lite Online editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/custom/vega).\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to Python, there are other language layers for Vega-Lite. The most popular of which is the [Javascript library](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite-api). It's very similar to the Python version so it's fairly straightforward to translate. The reason we're going to prefer Altair over the Javascript implementation is largely due to the data analysis ecosystem we have in Python. Tools like Pandas make data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis much easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to try to cover some highlights of using Altair here, but very much encourage you to make use of online resources. Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A whole [online course](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum) by the creators of Vega-Lite. In fact, they show you have to use both Altair and the Javascript API.\n",
        "* The [Altair tutorial](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair-tutorial) from the creator of Altair, Jake Vanderplas\n",
        "\n",
        "Both will be useful resources if you get stuck or need more examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "This particular tutorial will not cover interactivity or really sophisticated filtering/transformation. For the most part, we will either use data that's already in a form we want or get it into shape using Pandas.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using two datasets here, the standard \"cars\" dataset (which has miles per gallon, cost, country of origin, horse power, etc.) and an [\"indicators\" dataset](http://www.bigcitieshealth.org/) that has various pieces of data for many cities in the US over time. Everything from demographics to the number of food poisonings. We've cleaned up the data a little bit for this exercise but you can grab the full data from [this github](https://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets/tree/master/vega_datasets/_data).\n",

        "In this tutorial we will often slice-and-dice data to it's suitable for the examples we want to show. We will do this using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), a data manipulation library. Each block of code contains comments that explain the Pandas operations being used."
